/**
 * {@link PlaywrightDriver} over the OFFICIAL Playwright Java API, executed by playwright4j: the Driver
 * replacement spawns a second Java process ({@code GraalDriverMain}) hosting the Playwright Core JS driver on
 * GraalJS, which in turn launches the browser: by default the managed Camoufox (Firefox over WebDriver BiDi,
 * downloaded once and verified by {@link CamoufoxProvisioning}, started with its fingerprint profile in a
 * persistent context, as Argos does), or the locally installed Chrome/Edge via the channel mechanism.
 * Playwright itself never downloads a browser ({@code PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1} is always set).
 *
 * <p>Lifecycle owned here (one research session per runtime instance): Playwright → Browser → one
 * BrowserContext → one Page + history. Popups are closed immediately, downloads are refused, and when a
 * request filter is given, browser-side requests to disallowed targets are aborted via route interception.
 * {@link #close()} tears down page → context → browser → Playwright (ending the driver child) and is
 * idempotent.</p>
 *
 * <p>THREADING CONTRACT: every instance is created and used on exactly ONE thread (the
 * {@link BrowserSessionActor} owner). Playwright Java is not thread-safe, and its events (route
 * interception, exposeBinding, popups) are only dispatched while that thread runs a Playwright call —
 * which is why the actor keeps {@link #pumpEvents} running whenever no command is queued. Every
 * Playwright-touching method asserts the owner via {@link ThreadOwnershipGuard}.</p>
