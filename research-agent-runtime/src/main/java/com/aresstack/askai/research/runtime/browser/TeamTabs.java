/**
 * The page browser of the research team (plan T5): ONE user context of this chat's worker browsers, and in it one
 * tab per page worker. Every worker navigates only its own tab; all tabs share the window, the site leases of the
 * worker browsers (two tabs never on the same site at the same time) and their engine refusal (a tab never opens a
 * search engine; searching is the search browser's job). The user context is opened with the first worker and
 * closed when the last one has given its tab back.
 *
 * <p>Thread-safe. The number of tabs is bounded by the "Tabs/user context" setting of the worker browsers. When
 * every tab is taken, a worker waits for one that another search gives back, at most the worker browsers' wait
 * setting ({@link BrowserUserContextPool#acquireTimeoutMillis()}), then fails honestly — live run 4 (2026-11-10):
 * the first planned search held all four tabs until its end and the next three planned searches failed at once
 * for want of a tab, which paused the whole plan after one search.</p>
