/**
 * Real capability probing before the browser runtime reports the Playwright backend as usable. Checks, in order:
 * (1) the effective {@code com.microsoft.playwright.impl.driver.Driver} is playwright4j's replacement (its
 * child command runs {@code GraalDriverMain} — the upstream one would try to install/spawn Node),
 * (2) the Playwright Core JS driver package is on the classpath (embedded in the playwright4j jar),
 * (3) an executable for the configured browser channel exists locally — except for the managed Camoufox,
 * which the launch installs and verifies itself ({@link CamoufoxProvisioning}).
 * Launchability itself is verified by the actual launch at session start ({@code BROWSER_START_FAILED}).
 * The probe itself NEVER downloads or installs anything.
