/**
 * MODEL PORT v2: the platform's single model access for in-process plugins (ADR 0001, 3.2 and 4.5). It
 * replaces the plugin's own Ollama HTTP clients; the narrow
 * {@link com.aresstack.askai.agent.model.inference.AgentInferencePort} stays for its existing callers.
 *
 * <p><b>What a caller sees.</b> Model slots ({@link ModelSlot}), messages, tool definitions and tool calls,
 * output formats, a stream of thinking and content chunks, a cancel handle, and an opaque view of the
 * resources. <b>What it never sees.</b> Ollama, Jackson, HTTP, model names, endpoint URLs or provider
 * options. The platform implements the port on its one Ollama client (ollama4j) and its central model
 * configuration.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Calls.</b> {@link #chat} covers every call shape the research roles use: plain chat, chat with
 * tools (the model requests tool calls, the CALLER executes them and sends tool-result messages back in the
 * next call), structured output with a JSON schema, and streaming with thinking chunks. The port never
 * executes a tool and never loops on its own; one call is one model turn. Every call is cancellable.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Resource scheduling.</b> The platform owns a scheduler over an endpoint pool. Each model on each
 * endpoint has a capacity (concurrent calls; a user setting, default 1, mirroring the endpoint's own
 * parallelism). A call needs a place of that capacity: either explicitly reserved beforehand with
 * {@link #reserve} (the task executor's path, so it knows a worker can run before dispatching it), or
 * reserved implicitly by {@link #chat(ChatRequest, ChatListener)} for the duration of one call. The
 * scheduler never admits more calls than the capacity, so nothing waits invisibly in the provider's queue.
 * With capacity 1 on one GPU everything runs one after another; with capacity 4 four independent workers
 * run at once; with several endpoints the same caller code spreads over them.</p>
 *
 * <p>Residency (which models are loaded) is advisory: the platform keeps the active model warm, groups
 * waiting work by model and plans a model switch as a deliberate step, but the provider's unload behaviour
 * is not contractual. Callers must never rely on a model staying loaded; {@link #resources()} is for
 * planning and diagnostics, not for correctness.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Threading.</b> No method blocks the calling thread. Listener callbacks and future completions run
 * on platform threads.</p>

     * by the port, never leaked.
